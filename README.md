# Numerical_Methods

This is a repository for numerical methods for solving a equation or set of equations. These programs are written in MatLab2016. These are free to use for self and commercial purposes. Enjoy.

The numerical methods include/will include:
1. Bisection Method- Done
2. False Position or Regula Falsi Method- Done.
3. Fixed Point Iteration- This is not an actual method, but a class of methods so I can obviously cannot code this method.
4. Newton-Raphson's Method- Done
5. Gauss-Siedel
6. Gauss Jordan Method
7. Jacobi's Method

Please tell me somehow what all next methods should I include
